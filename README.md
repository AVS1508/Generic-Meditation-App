# Generic Meditation App
A vanilla JavaScript web application to practice meditation or improve productivity by listening to ambient serene music for stipulated amounts of time. This project is based on DevelopedByEd's YouTube tutorial for a vanilla JS meditation app, with a few minor tweaks from my side.

## Functionality
1. Listen to ambient music, accompanied by visually appealing sceneries, choosing between:
   - Rainy Mode
   - Beach Mode
2. Choose and set timers from 8 different time slots ranging from 2 minutes to 90 minutes:
   - 2 minutes
   - 5 minutes
   - 10 minutes
   - 20 minutes
   - 30 minutes
   - 45 minutes
   - 60 minutes
   - 90 minutes
3. Use the app in a background tab, the music will continue uninterrupted! Play and pause as you wish!
## Upcoming Improvements
1. Introducing a Slider for Volume Control!
